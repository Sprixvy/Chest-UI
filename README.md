# Chest-UI
A custom version of Herobrine's Chest UI for Minecraft. Based on the original project, with personal modifications and improvements. A Minecraft Bedrock project that alters the Action Form to look & function like a chest does, without the hassle of entities or physical items.

In this modified version, Enchantments and Custom Names for items were added to the inventory section of the Chest UI. The Furnace UI and pattern function have been removed from this version. Same goes for the 1 and 5 chest sizes.
